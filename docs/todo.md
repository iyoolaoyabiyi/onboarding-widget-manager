#### **Foundation (Monday)**

- **10:00 AM - Setup:**
    - Initialize Monorepo: `apps/dashboard` (Next.js) and `packages/widget` (Vite).
    - Set up Supabase/Firebase project and share API keys with all 6 members.
- **01:00 PM - Core Logic:**
    - **Team Dashboard:** Build the Form to input `steps` and save to DB. Don't worry about UI beauty yet.
    - **Team Embed:** Create a dummy HTML page. Hardcode a JSON tour object. Build a script that highlights an element based on ID.
    - **Team Marketing:** Build the Landing Page structure and integrate the Auth provider.
- **06:00 PM - Checkpoint:**
    - Can we log in?
    - Can we save a tour to the DB?
    - Does the hardcoded widget highlight a div?

#### **Integration & The "Handshake" (Tuesday)**
- **10:00 AM - The Connection:**
    - **Team Embed:** Stop using hardcoded JSON. Fetch the real data from the DB using the ID.
    - **Team Dashboard:** Build the "Analytics" view. It should read the dummy events Team Embed sends.
- **02:00 PM - Animation & Polish:**
    - **Team Marketing:** Add GSAP scroll animations to the landing page. Write the "Docs" page.
    - **Team Embed:** Add the **Three.js** avatar. It can be a simple floating sphere or robot that follows the user if a full character is too hard.
    - **Team Dashboard:** Style the form to look professional.
- **08:00 PM - Dogfooding:**
    - Take the script generated by the Dashboard.
    - Embed it onto the Landing Page (built by Team Marketing).
    - **Goal:** The Landing Page should have a tour explaining itself.

#### **Day 3: Final Polish & Submit (Wednesday)**
- **10:00 AM - Cleanup:**
    - Fix z-index issues (widget hiding behind navbars).
    - Ensure "Skip Tour" works.
    - Record the demo video.
- **02:00 PM - Deployment:**
    - Deploy Dashboard/Marketing to Vercel.
    - Deploy Widget to Vercel (ensure CORS is enabled so other sites can load the script).
- **06:00 PM - Documentation:**
    - Update README with setup steps.
    - Verify all Acceptance Criteria.
- **11:00 PM:** Submit.
