          <h2>Why Onboarding Matters</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>First impressions shape product adoption.</li>
            <li>
              Users are more likely to stay when they understand how to use your
              interface.

              support requests.

            <li>
              A good onboarding experience improves retention and overall
              product success.
